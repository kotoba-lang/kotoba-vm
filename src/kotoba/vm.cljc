  "Machine / Call Manager: apply a message to an actor tree.

  This is the FVM Machine analogue for a Kotoba app-chain. It is not
  Filecoin's FVM, not an EVM, and not a database kernel. The proving
  slice is: IPLD syscalls, invocation-local handles, a message-local
  overlay that flushes on success and drops on revert, fuel charged
  before effect, nested sync `actor/call` with child-revert.

  ## Seams

  `apply-message` is the whole-tree entry. Nested mutations of other
  actors need this — `inga.state`'s `:invoke-fn` is only allowed to
  write the callee's own record, so the thin `invoke-fn` adapter here
  wraps a single-actor `apply-message` and maps exits onto
  `inga.state/refusal-reasons`.

  `:get-fn` / `:put!` are the io-ipld storage port. This repo does not
  depend on inga or codebase; they inject this, or they don't.

  ## What this is not

  - kototama: Wasm host / runtime-link. Not an IPLD actor tree.
  - codebase.actor: a pure `(state, message) → next-state`. No syscalls.
  - io-filecoin: a Filecoin protocol client. No actor state, no HAMT, no FVM.
  - kotoba-lang/machine: hardware CPU/cache descriptors. Not this Machine.
  - the historical etzhayyim `kotoba-vm` Rust Pregel crate. Different repo,
    different plane, retired with the Rust engine."
