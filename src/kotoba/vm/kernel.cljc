(ns kotoba.vm.kernel
  "Invocation-local handles, a message-local block overlay, and the IPLD
  syscalls a guest is allowed to issue.

  This is the FVM Kernel analogue (FIP-0030's syscall surface) without
  Filecoin's HAMT, EVM opcodes, or Unix-shaped calls. A guest that wants
  to touch state goes through these functions. There is no ambient
  Clojure, no `get-fn` on the object the guest sees, and no path that
  writes the store until the Machine flushes a successful message.

  ## Overlay vs store

  Reads consult the overlay first, then the injected `:get-fn`. A miss
  in the overlay that hits the store is one boundary crossing and one
  byte copy (ADR-2608590000 Boundary A). Writes land in the overlay
  only. `flush!` is the Machine's job on success; revert is dropping
  the overlay.

  ## Handles

  Integer ids, invocation-local, discarded when the invocation returns.
  A nested `:actor/call` starts a child with an empty handle table.
  The child's overlay starts as a snapshot of the parent's; on child
  failure the parent's overlay is restored to that snapshot (the
  caller's writes from before the call stay, the callee's do not).

  ## Fuel

  Every syscall charges before it acts. If the charge would pass the
  budget the context becomes `:exhausted?` and the effect does not
  run. Nested spent is kept even when the child's writes are dropped —
  work happened, state did not move."
