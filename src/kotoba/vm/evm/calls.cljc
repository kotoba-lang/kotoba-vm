(ns kotoba.vm.evm.calls
  "Call-family and log opcodes for the evm-calls slice (Paris fork).

  CALL / STATICCALL / DELEGATECALL run the callee's code as a fresh
  child machine built with `kotoba.vm.evm.core/make-machine` and
  executed by `core/run`. One mechanism, three frame kinds:

    CALL          child gets caller = this frame's ADDRESS, mock value
                  move on the ledger, own storage
    STATICCALL    child is :static — every state-mutating opcode
                  (SSTORE, LOG, CREATE/CREATE2, non-static CALL) is an
                  exceptional halt inside the child
    DELEGATECALL  child runs in the PARENT's account context: parent
                  storage, parent address, parent caller/value

  CALLCODE (0xf2) is NOT wired: the dispatcher sends it to the
  undefined-opcode path (\"invalid opcode 0xf2\"), per this slice's
  scope.

  CREATE / CREATE2 ride a mock EAM: the init code runs as a child; its
  RETURN payload becomes the deployed code and a deterministic mock
  address (keccak over caller ++ kind-separator ++ nonce-or-salt,
  truncated to 20 bytes) is pushed. NOT the real EIP-68 / CREATE2
  init-code-hash scheme — mock EAM shape only; the real EAM lives in
  the FVM.

  The child's returndata flows back: on success (or revert) the parent
  copies min(retSize, len) bytes to retOffset and sets :returndata.
  Success pushes 1, failure 0 — a child :invalid also reports failure
  with no state retention. Storage revert semantics: the child gets a
  COPY of the parent store; on child failure the copy is dropped, so a
  reverted frame simply never publishes its writes.

  LOG0..4 append {:address :topics :data} to the machine's :logs.
  Gas uses the mock schedule: 375 base + 375/topic + 8/byte (LOG) and
  flat mock costs for the call family — the 63/64 rule and EIP-2929
  access costs are documented omissions; the profile stays :partial."
